Dungeon Quest Pet created by Brytenwally from WoW Modding Community https://discord.gg/Y3aF7yrXUH.

Oryginal Post: 

Hey everyone, I created a pet that will give you (hopefully) all the quests for the dungeon that you're in. 
Simply run the SQL query in your acore_world database, log-in and run command: .additem 34425 with a gm account

You can also use the excelt file attached to implement custom quests/zones to your pet.~
